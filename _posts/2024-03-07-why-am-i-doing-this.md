The truth is, I don't know where to start. I'm Pau, a developer just like any other, who, taking advantage of the holidays, has decided to set up this site. Why? Well, because for years I've had the domain but I've used it privately to access my resources or run tests, but I thought, why not create a small site to share my knowledge, experiments, and adventures.

The idea of this site, apart from giving me a bit more visibility, is to have a place where I can share my knowledge, since as a hobby, I usually experiment with new technologies, whether it's IoT, 3D printing, or just programming.
