The truth is, I don't know where to start.

I'm Pau, a developer just like any other, who, taking advantage of the holidays, has decided to set up this site.

Why? Well, because for years I've had the domain but I've used it privately to access my resources or run tests, but I thought, why not create a small site to share my knowledge, experiments, and adventures with other people? 

The idea of this site, apart from giving me a bit more visibility, is to have a place where I can share my knowledge, since as a hobby, I usually experiment with new technologies, whether it's IoT, 3D printing, or just programming.

Currently, I'm in the process of automating my home. Going into a bit of detail, I already have blinds, heating, and some lights (the ones I usually leave on). All of this is centralized using HomeAssistant software.

I'm also quite a fan of 3D printing. Being able to create the piece you need for a specific purpose is amazing to me, and being able to do it at home is even better. I have a modified Ender3Pro printer, where I've installed the extruder from the Ender3s1Pro, as well as its motherboard, along with a dual Z-axis and Klipper installed on a Raspberry Pi (powered by the printer itself).

Of course, it goes without saying that the printer itself can be turned on and off using HomeAssistant and can be managed using the printer's own web interface panel.

I'm also interested in topics such as security, networking, infrastructure like Docker or Kubernetes, etc.

I think this gives you an idea of how curious I am, and you also know a bit more about me and what interests me.

I hope the site is useful for you.
